Shenandoah Single vs Multi-pass Sampling
===========================================

Cleaning before entry into R:
* Did text to columns by comma to separate coded notes into columns
* Replaced "MORT" and other non-numeric mortality notes with 7
* Made a 'dead' column that was comprised of notes 7 (mortality) and 10 (whole fish collected)
* Replaced `'` and `"` with blank to avoid problems reading in text columns
* Replaced `ND` (No Data) with `NA` for missing data
* Changed `Species` to `Code` in the fish data headers to be able to merge with the species data (could do in R after import)
* Added primary key

```{r setup, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
